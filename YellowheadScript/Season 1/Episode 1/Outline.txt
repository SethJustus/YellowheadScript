** Episode starts AFTER aliks sin **
// I don't really want to start the first episode on Alik
// I want the audience to think that Zenon is the main character, before transfering that role to Atlas
// It might be ok, as long as we hard focus the kids later in the episode
** A bleak day in early winter **
** Alik is introduced as a tall, powerful, and terrified man of age 25 **
Alik rushes home in a panic
Alik is greeted at the door by a woman, who asks him what is wrong
"I'm in trouble"
"*laughs* you??! *Grabs his arm* They couldn't do anything to you if they wanted too"
Alik pulls away from her quickly, checking the back rooms of the house
There is a knock on the door, Alik opens it to find a man standing there with an arrest warrent
"*The woman inside laughs hysterically* oh kill him Alik! This is an offense on your honor!"
Alik looks past the man, where a woman is standing on a roof, shrouded in white moths
Alik lets the man take him away

Two guards take Alik before "the council of witchcraft and war"
Aliks father is on the council
Aliks life if spared because of his fathers position, and his physical giftedness
"The potential to be among the greatest warriors to ever live", "It would be a waste"
Alik is stripped of his position
Alik is sent to the Dunamis atonement district

** A snowy dusk in the atonement district**
Alik rides to the district on a horse
Alik sees a huge white rabbit on the other side of a river inside the barrier
Alik is greeted by a disrespectful but kindly guard
The guard takes a small sample of Aliks blood for the barrier
"Unfortunate timing to arrive on darkest night"
"The barrier will hold you in for a while"
"stay on your best behavour and someone will come get you out"
Alik dismounts, and hands the horse to the guard
Alik carries his things through the district barrier
Alik is now trapped inside the district

Zenon parries the attack, Alik quickly rounds on Zenon with a set of quick light attacks
