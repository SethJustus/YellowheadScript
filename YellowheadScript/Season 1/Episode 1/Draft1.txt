// Scene 1: Brightest Night Celebration
EXT. Atonement District. Late Autumn, Late Afternoon / Early Dusk
The town is mideval-victorian in style, each house unique, most of them a bit run down.
Bright autumn trees grow inbetween houses from the surrounding forest, all the way to the town square.
A consistant cold breeze sends fallen leaves tumbling down the streets and allyways.
The light is mix of the warm orange light from the setting sun, and the blinding white emitted from an enormous object in the sky
Like a moon so large it fills the entire sky, a great glowing city. If you look close enough you can barely see faint lines like roads, and shapes like great towers and buildings.
