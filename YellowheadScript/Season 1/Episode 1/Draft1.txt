// Scene 1: Brightest Night Celebration
EXT. Atonement District. Late Autumn, Late Afternoon / Early Dusk
The town is mideval-victorian in style, each house unique, most of them a bit run down.
Bright autumn trees grow inbetween houses from the surrounding forest, all the way to the town square at the center.
A consistant cold breeze sends fallen leaves tumbling down the cobbled streets and allys.
The light is a mix of the warm orange light from the setting sun, and the bright white emitted from an enormous glowing object in the sky just peeking over the horizon.
In the street, two boys are walking side by side.
The boys have a clear family resemblence with dark hair, thoughtful eyes, and angular features.
But while the younger boy (Atlas 14) already has a strong athletic look to him, the older (Zenon 16) is smaller, thinner, even sickly by comparison.
Atlas carried a large wooden barrel, while Zenon carried a few food items in a basket.
They cross into the town square.
The town square is a huge open space with a large clock tower at the center.
Many many long tables have been set up, and are being filled with food and drink.
Atlas sets the barrel down with a hundred others just like it, and Zenon carries his basket to one of the tables.
Hundreds of people are already gathered, and more are arriving.
Rose: (off screen) Zenon! Atlas!
Zenon looks to see a small, wiry, redheaded girl (Rose 12) smiling, running towards them.
Behind her a lanky older girl (Chloe 16) is strolling, and nods in their direction.
Zenon: (smiling) Rosie!
Rosie: (hugs Zenon) then starts chattering, excitedly gesturing around
Zenon: (listening intently)
Atlas: (smiles) Chloe
Chloe: (Turning to walk besides Atlas) Hey
Atlas: Are we going to your house after the celebration?
Chloe: (shrugs) if you guys want to, Rosie wanted to sit on your roof again though
Rosie: (lights up) Yes please, the roof is the best place to see the view!
Zenon: (shares a worried look with Atlas) Lets do Rosies roof, it is pretty much the same as ours
Rosie: Dad already made cider, h-
The crowd starts to boo and jeer, and loud clanking sounds can be heard.
Chloe: (sneers) The GRAND knight
Rosie: (sighs)
A man is a huge suit of armor has left the clock tower and is walking through the square.
On his back is a large circular shield, and on his hip is a long broadsword.
Each slow lurching step in the armor appears to be a struggle, and makes a sound like a ratchet being turned, before the foot strikes the cobbles with a clang.
Unknown: (off screen) Coward!
Unknown: (off screen) Witch dog!
Someone throws a pastry at the knight, and it sticks to the fine armor before sliding off.
More food is thrown, along with a few rocks and a chair, but no one gets within arms reach.
The knight doesn't react, but continues his laborious march out of town.
Slowly the crowd quiets, and the only sound is the knights footfalls.
When he steps past the edge of the square, the crown erupts in cheers and applause.
People start moving towards tables and barrels, and the square is filled with the sounds of laughter and conversation.
Atlas: (somberly) I don't really get it, its not like he could protect us anyways, he can barely walk.
Zenon: (nods)
Atlas: (laughing) Theres just no way he can fight, hell, Rosie could probably take him!
Rosie: Dad says the armor is clockwork, and he just never turns it on for some reason. 
Chloe: (snorts) They would never send a knight with clockwork armor HERE, it is way too valuable.
Chloe: If the armor is clockwork, then it is clearly broken. But it definitely isn't.
Atlas: (Nods agreement)
Rosie: (defensive) You can hear it winding up when he walks! Right Zenon?
Zenon: Maybe, but there is no way to know for sure. Lets just enjoy the celebration.

Like a moon so large it nearly fills the entire sky, a great glowing city is floating in the atmosephere. 
If you look close enough you can barely see faint lines like roadways, and shapes like towers and buildings.
