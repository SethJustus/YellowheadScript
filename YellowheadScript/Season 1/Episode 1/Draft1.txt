// Scene 1: Brightest Night Celebration
EXT. Atonement District. Late Autumn, Late Afternoon / Early Dusk
The town is mideval-victorian in style, each house unique, most of them a bit run down.
Bright autumn trees grow inbetween houses from the surrounding forest, all the way to the town square.
A consistant cold breeze sends fallen leaves tumbling down the cobbled streets and allys.
The light is mix of the warm orange light from the setting sun, and the blinding white emitted from an enormous object in the sky
Like a moon so large it nearly fills the entire sky, a great glowing city floating in the atmosephere. 
If you look close enough you can barely see faint lines like roads, and shapes like towers and buildings.
Back on the ground, two boys are walking side by side.
The boys have a clear family resemblence with dark hair, thoughtful eyes, and angular features.
But while the younger boy (Atlas 14) already has a strong athletic look to him, the older (Zenon 15) is thin and even sickly.
