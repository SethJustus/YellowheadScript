In this scene, the purger is having a meal at an inn.
Leon and Edmund are fighting for the attention of a serving girl.
The rivalry ends with them getting thrown out of the inn, where they fight in the mud in the ally.
The girl comes out to watch, but is obviously not impressed.
The two become good friends.

Edmund and Leon scramble out of the mud to face her.

	EDMUND
	(bows)
	My lady
	
	TAVERN GIRL
	(smiles faintly)
	I thought you two might want to know, I'm betrothed.

She spins on her heal, smiles flirtatiously over her shoulder, and slams the door.
Leon and Edmund stand there in the rain, jaws hanging loose, for a long moment.

	EDMUND
	What. A. WHORE!!
			 (punches wall)

Edmund turns to Leon, incredulous

	LEON
	WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

	EDMUND
	BETROTHED?!?! she can't be THAT much older then us?!

	LEON
	(shoots a hateful glare towards the window)
	I'll bet shes lying about it.

	EDMUND
	(hysterical)
	WHY?!? Shes got two HEROS trying to win her hand!

Leon shakes his head in confusion

	LEON
	(shrugs)
	Her loss I guess
