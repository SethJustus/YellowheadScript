In this scene, the purger is having a meal at an inn.
Leon and Edmund have had a rivalry for the past days, and it comes to a head in this scene.
Leon and Edmund are fighting for the attention of a serving girl.

Edmund wants the girl + the ego boost of winning her over.
Leon wants to boost his ego, and outshine Edmund.

INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

The tavern is brightly lit, and filled with people. Leon sits at a table with the other squires and low level purgers. On the far side of the table, Edmund
sits laughing, and drinking. 

	MT
	Look over there, Leon.

MT gestures towards the end of the table.
A beautiful serving girl refills Edmund's drink, and he says something that makes her laugh.

	MT
	He's been sweet talking her the whole night.
	I'd say this is your chance to get back at him, but what do I know

She works her way around the table, and gets to Leon.

	LEON
	Thanks, thats perfect...
	... just like you.

	SERVING GIRL
	(smiles dimly)
	You're too kind

MT flinches, but Leon doesn't notice.
Leon grins, and meets Edmund's hate filled gaze with a shrug.

... Important exposition between different characters ...

The serving girl comes back to the table with plates of food, and when she places Edmund's plate in front of him, he says something.
She turns to him with a smile, and they talk for a few moments.

	LEON
	(to MT)
	Watch this

	MT
	(sighs)
	(loudly with a smile)
	ALL RIGHT THEN, LET'S SETTLE THIS!

MT sets his arm out on the table.

	LEON
	(confused)
	what?

	MT
	(loudly)
	WHAT? YOU SCARED?

Several people turn to watch as Leon and MT set up for an arm wrestle.
They begin and Leon somehow starts winning.
Leon pins MT to the table, and several watchers cheer.
The serving girl sets down a plate in front of Leon

	SERVING GIRL
	(smiling)
	That was definitely unexpected

// Leon and Edmund progressivly take turns trying to impress the serving girl

// A bouncer throws them out into the allyway

// They fight

The door to the ally opens, and the serving girl dumps out some slop into the mud by the door.

Edmund and Leon scramble out of the mud to face her.

	EDMUND
	(bows)
	My lady
	
	TAVERN GIRL
	(smiles faintly)
	I thought you two might want to know, I am betrothed.

She spins on her heal, smiles flirtatiously over her shoulder, and slams the door.
Leon and Edmund stand there in the rain, jaws hanging loose, for a long moment.

	EDMUND
	What. A. WHORE!!
			 (punches wall)

Edmund turns to Leon, incredulous

	LEON
	WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

	EDMUND
	BETROTHED?!?! she can't be THAT much older then us?!

Leon shoots a hatefule glare towards the window.

	LEON
	I'll bet shes lying about it.

	EDMUND
	(hysterical)
	WHY?!? Shes got two HEROS trying to win her heart!

Leon shakes his head in confusion

	LEON
	(shrugs)
	Her loss I guess

Edmund kicks the mud

	EDMUND
	(dejected)
	Yeah.
	
Silence for a moment

	LEON
	Are they really not letting us back in?

	EDMUND
	(smirks)
	Let's sneak in the back, worst they can do is throw us back out

	LEON
	(grins)
	They can TRY! Together, we could probably whip that bouncer anyways

	EDMUND
	I must say, you are a lot stronger than you look

	LEON
	Same for you

Together they walk down the allyway
