In this scene, the purger is having a meal at an inn.
Leon and Edmund are fighting for the attention of a serving girl.
The rivalry ends with them getting thrown out of the inn, where they fight in the mud in the ally.
The girl comes out to watch, but is obviously not impressed.
The two become good friends.

INT. TAVERN - NIGHT


// A girl serving drinks and food catches Leons eye

// Leon and Edmund progressivly take turns trying to impress the serving girl

// A bouncer throws them out into the ally

// They fight

The door to the ally opens, and the serving girl dumps out some slop into the mud by the door.

Edmund and Leon scramble out of the mud to face her.

	EDMUND
	(bows)
	My lady
	
	TAVERN GIRL
	(smiles faintly)
	I thought you two might want to know, I am betrothed.

She spins on her heal, smiles flirtatiously over her shoulder, and slams the door.
Leon and Edmund stand there in the rain, jaws hanging loose, for a long moment.

	EDMUND
	What. A. WHORE!!
			 (punches wall)

Edmund turns to Leon, incredulous

	LEON
	WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

	EDMUND
	BETROTHED?!?! she can't be THAT much older then us?!

Leon shoots a hatefule glare towards the window.

	LEON
	I'll bet shes lying about it.

	EDMUND
	(hysterical)
	WHY?!? Shes got two HEROS trying to win her heart!

Leon shakes his head in confusion

	LEON
	(shrugs)
	Her loss I guess

Edmund kicks the mud

	EDMUND
	(dejected)
	Yeah.
	
Silence for a moment

	LEON
	Are they really not letting us back in?

	EDMUND
	(smirks)
	Let's sneak in the back, worst they can do is throw us back out

	LEON
	(grins)
	They can TRY! Together, we could probably whip that bouncer anyways

	EDMUND
	I must say, you are a lot stronger than you look

	LEON
	Same for you

Together they walk down the allyway
