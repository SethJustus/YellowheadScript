INT. TAVERN - NIGHT
ALIK sits at the bar, drinking whisky, and smoking a cigar. The tavern is fairly packed, but the people leave space
around him. The door opens, and ERYX and KYROS walk in. They are met with a warm welcome from the patrons. Eryx sits on
the stool next to Alik, while Kyros takes the next one down.
	ERYX
	We will have whatever he's having

The bartender pours them each a glass, and Eryx takes a sip. Alik completely ignores him.

	ERYX
	You know friend, we could use a strong fellow like you in the months to come.

	ALIK
	(sniffs)
	Now why would that be?

	KYROS
	I'm suprised you haven't caught wind of our purpose here. Me and my friend over there are here to save this town from
	that unholy beast.

	ALIK
	(turns and laughs)
	so THATS why you came! And here I was thinking you were just criminals sentanced to death like everyone else.

Alik turns back to his drink, and Kyros' expression darkens.

	ERYX
	(leans back casually)
	Well, that's technically true, although I personally wouldn't call Alchemy a crime.

Alik ignore him, and swirls his drink
Eryx sighs and gets up, walking over to talk to a group of people at a table. Kyros takes his seat.
	
	KYROS
	(leaning forward, confused)
	Don't you WANT to be rid of the thing? With the help of people like you, we c-

Kyros looks past Alik at the sword leaning against the bar.

	KYROS
	Oh you're the knight aren't you?

Alik stops moving

	KYROS
	You ARE! Alik Brandburn in the flesh! I saw you once, before all that nasty buisness with those farmers of course. 
	You were much... greater back then. You were-

Alik turns to face him, and Kyros flinches

	ALIK
	(quietly)
	What do you want?
	
	KYROS
	I want you to do your sworn duty and protect your ward.

	ALIK
	It's my DUTY to let these people die.

	KYROS
	(sighs)
	I suppose that IS your speciallity

Alik stands up, and Kyros jumps back, toppling his stool. The tavern goes quiet

	KYROS
	I had always assumed they had you executed, but I guess daddy would never let THAT happen. How long has it been now... 7 years? 
	You're lucky he was still alive to save you then, god rest his soul.

	ALIK
	What?

	KYROS
	You didn't know? Your father died not long after you left, I assumed news had reached you by now...

Alik walks out of the tavern, and Kyros turns and yells after him

	KYROS
	Looks like your staying longer than expected!
