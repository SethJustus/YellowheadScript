Everything moves in the forgotten city,
Blocks rotate, buildings rise, rotate, grow, and fall. 
Buildings are always moving to touch another building nearby like neurons in a brain.
Blue and Purple lights flicker inbetween the buildings.
Once a flash of light pulses between two buildings, the signal is pulsed swiftly back to the center, building by building .
Multiple layers of city lay on top of one another, held up with thick columns
buildings grow downwards from higher layers, nearly touching the buildings on the layer below
Layers rotate independently of one another, and city blocks rearange themselves within the layers
