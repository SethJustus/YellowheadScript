Everything moves in the forgotten city,
Blocks rotate, buildings rise, grow, and fall
Blue and Purple lights flicker inbetween the buildings
Multiple layers of city lay on top of one another, held up with thick columns
buildings grow downwards from higher layers and nearly touch the buildings on the layer below
Layers rotate independently of one another, and city blocks rearange themselves within the layers
