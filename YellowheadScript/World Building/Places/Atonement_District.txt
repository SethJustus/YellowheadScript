on brightest nights, the people of the atonement district hold a feast - a last meal of sorts
on darkest night the district manager, counts the number of people to be added, and piles a stone for each one
the bargest appears in the district and chooses the same number of people as stones - then the newcomers are let in
people who are chosen by the bargest are cursed to die within the next 6 months
the people of the district are expected to output a quota of work, and if they don't, the bargest will choose double the amount
generally speaking, the bargest doesn't kill people, just curses them, but it will kill people in self defense
any wound the bargest inflicts will not heal, and the person will slowly bleed out.
A witch holds everyone in the district with a magical barrier
the barrier only applies to people whos blood is incorporated into the spell
When people are added to the district, they are cut, and their blood is given to the witch
