This applies to Gallia happer pairs.
Every time a hammer claims a life, the warrior counts it. And when the fight is done, they are to buy an iron sphere for each death and have the head reforged with the new metal.
When the weight of death is too much to swing, the warrior is done fighting.
The first hammer given a new warrior is made of a light wood with a thin iron coating.
