EXT. CAPITAL CITY. LATE MORNING

INT. THE HOUSE THEY ARE STAYING IN. NIGHT
Camera looks down the hallway, towards the front door. The door opens, and an exhausted ATLAS walks in.
He is covered in blood and bent under the weight of his wings.
As he walks towards his room, he sees the door to ROSIES room open a crack, and a shimmering light is coming from inside. 
Atlas hesitantly pushes the door open.
Rosie is lying in bed asleep, but as she dreams, an impossible night sky opens above her in the room. 
The city is there, closer than it should be. 
The camera watches through the crack in the door from the hallway, as Atlas slides down against the wall, his wings unfurling on the floor.
He lets his sword be forgotten.

Naming convention
People from Dunastia have Greek sounding names.
Outline
Zenon lives in the atonement sector of Dunastia. 
He lives in a house with his mother and his younger brother Atlas.
A grand knight named Fulk is assigned guardian of the sector after a terrible political mistake.

World

Dunastia is one of the seven holy city states.
It was completely crushed and disgraced when it tried to war the other six.
Dunastia maintains a population of ~100,000. 
The population of the atonement sector is ~800 – 1,200.


 There are 2 low magic systems, Witchcraft and alchemy, although sometimes engineering is seen as a type of alchemy.
 And two high magic systems, Faith and Dark Faith. 
 Witchcraft is a low practice of Dark Faith. 
 The more a witch understands a spell, the weaker it gets.
 Therefore, the practice of witchcraft is purely emotional, casting and charming on whims. 
 Alchemy, a low practice of Faith, on the other hand is an exact science. 
 An alchemist must have a strong understanding to create potions and powders. 
 Faith is the manipulation of the dream through belief, expectation, and memory. 
 The more important a person is to the dreamer, the stronger the effect of their faith.
 All creatures with any amount of soul, practice Faith to some degree, intentionally or not.
 Dark Faith is the manipulation of the dream through disbelief, distraction, and forgetfulness. 
 Once any object is completely forgotten or discarded by the souls in the dream, it becomes a part of the dark dream, and is now at the disposal of Ralagor and the practitioners of dark faith.
 All elements of the dark dream are completely intangible to elements of the dream, except through crimson vessels. 
 Crimson vessels are objects or people with a foot in each dream, a dark object interacting with a crimson vessel can also interact with red objects. 
 For example, a person of the dream can follow a crimson vessel through a forgotten door into a forgotten room of a house.
 Crimson vessels become darker over time, and part of the dark dream eventually. 
 If a crimson vessel is a human or animal, this transition can be seen in the color of their blood.
