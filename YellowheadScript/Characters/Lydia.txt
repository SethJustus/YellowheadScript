Lydia is Atlas and Zenon's mother.
There was some kind of prophecy during her pregnancy that said her child "was the chosen one"(idk, something like that)
She assumes Atlas is the special child, and she shuns + neglects Zenon.
Lydia is emotionally abusive. She is sometimes kind, and sometimes horrible, but she is always manipulative.
She guilts Zenon for hard feelings despite treating him terribly.
A social climber, Lydia pursues relations with anyone powerful in the district.
