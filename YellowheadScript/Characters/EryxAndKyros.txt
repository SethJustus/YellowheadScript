Of the two alchemists who enter the atonement district in episode 1
Eryx is much more charasmatic, and has a ton of influence of the district
Kyros has a harder time keeping his true colors hidden, but is much much stronger at alchemy
Eryx is a wonderful lier, and his alchemy is reminiscent of a stage magician his focus is on impressing the people around him
Eryx is decent at puppets though
Kyros is a terrible lier, and his alchemy is actually useful in a fight, he is especially good at traps, and physical alchemy
Eryx always has a smooth answer to everything, but Kyros has a gruff demeanor
They don't actually like each other, but are both trying to escape the atonement district with their lives
