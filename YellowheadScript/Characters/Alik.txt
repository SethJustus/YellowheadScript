Alik winds his armor by walking in it without assistance
The audience + the district people think the armor is completely impractical because it's to heavy
When he unwinds the armor, he can move just as fast as normal, but with much more power

Alik doesn't care about anything or anyone in the atonement district except for himself and his equipment.
He is simply waiting for his time here to end, so he can go back to living the life he was meant to live.
Only when he realizes he will never get to leave does he start fighting for things again.
Once he starts fighting again, he quickly is able to leave the district.
